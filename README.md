# [L01: ASCII Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8/edit?usp=sharing)

This first lab is designed to help us learn to use our tools and to program in C++.

## Starter files have been provided for you in C++

### Author:
- Author of modified ASCII art program: *FIXME*

# Planning Prompts

1. **ART CHOICE**
*Go to [Christopher Johnson's ASCII Art Collection ](https://asciiart.website/) and find a piece of ASCII art that you would like to modify and render in C++ using cout.  What did you find? Please note that it is fine either to modify it only a little or quite significantly. Put the URL here AND also in a comment in your code or state that your art is original in both places.*

*FIXME*

2. **REASON FOR ART CHOICE**
*Why did this particular art appeal to you?*

*FIXME*

3. **USER INPUT**
*It is required that you incorporate input from the user, but this need not make you crazy. It can just be above or below your art if you want. It can also be put into a single character you print. Discuss how you plan to use the userâ€™s input.*

*FIXME*

4. **ESCAPE CHARACTERS**
*Identify the characters that will need to be escaped in your art, and discuss how the art will need to adjusted after adding these escape characters.*

*FIXME*

5. **PREPLAN**
*Later on in this course, we will focus more on developing a logical plan rather than fighting with syntax, but for this first lab, we need to conquer C++ syntax!  Write a bulleted list of your attack plan to achieve success on this lab.*

# Implementation & Customization Prompts

6. **TITLE**
*Please choose a title for you art.*

*FIXME*

7. **CUSTOMIZATIONS & MODIFICATIONS**
*What customizations and modifications did you ultimately make to the original art? (Remember that it is fine to modify it only a little or quite significantly.) Be sure to adjust your code comments to summarize your modifications. Remember  to save often and push your work up to Github. For a detailed workflow description on how to do this, see: [VS, Github, & ASCII art](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bz1sbwxid1ydkSHaO5nDMpMgzwa29Py6zzTlWGUvBzM)*.

*FIXME*

8. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process,
including how much your initial design plan evolved,
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent
as a programmer in accomplishing these results.
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*FIXME*

9. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the lab easier for you.*

*FIXME*

10. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*
- *FIXME*
- *FIXME*

11. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*FIXME*

# Update and Debug - Due at Final milestone

Note: All FIXME's should be *fixed* at each milestone, so there should be none left after final submission.

12. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.*
